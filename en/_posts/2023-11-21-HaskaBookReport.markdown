## Author's Background

I first encountered "HaskaSu" through his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@HaskaSu){:target="\_blank"}. With remarkably clear explanations, complex mathematical concepts commonly used in games are presented visually, which I found highly admirable.

## Key Highlights

- Ingenious use of mathematics to solve common problems in game design.
- Introduction to TypeScript.
- Open-source demo projects.

## Impressions

For novice game programmers, the content of this book can significantly reduce the learning curve in your future development journey. The clear explanations provided within help readers enhance their development skills. Even seasoned game developers can benefit from uncovering problem-solving techniques they may have overlooked in the past.

In the following sections, I will provide excerpts from some chapters, along with the results of implementing them and any details I discover along the way.
